# Nested For Loops


Nested loops are simply a loop within a loop. Most often we use such loops to fill in a matrix or iterate over two lists or other sequences. The point to be noted is the time complexity of such nested loops. For now, letâ€™s have in mind that nested for loops going to take more time compared to a single for loop. 

In programming terminology, we call it O(N) for a single loop i.e., pronounced as O of N, where N represents the length of a sequence like a list. 

So nested for loops take O(N^2), i.e., pronounced as O of N squared, where N represents the length of a sequence like a list.
