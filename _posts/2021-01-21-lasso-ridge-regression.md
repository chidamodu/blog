# Lasso Vs. Ridge Regression 


**Lasso Regression or L1**
1. It adds the absolute value of the coefficient terms. 
2. In Lasso, the slope values can be equal to 0.
3. Since it can exclude insignificant variables, it can be used as a feature selection method.  


**Ridge Regression or L2**
1. It adds the penalty term thatâ€™s equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients.
2. It reduces the coefficients or slope values, but the coefficients are never equal to 0. 
3. In practice, the ridge regression seems to perform better.
