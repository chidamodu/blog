# GlobalAveragePooling

GlobalPooling operates on spatial information, i.e., location information like edges and corners in image data. It has two options:
- Finding averaging
- Finding maximum

Letâ€™s talk about the first option, a, finding average. GlobalAveragePooling is an operation that calculates the average of each feature map in the previous layer. It has the following advantages:

1. It has no trainable parameters and therefore using this in a model architecture will help 		reducing the tendency to overfit.

2. Fully connected dense layers have a lot of parameters. Dropouts are typically added to such a network to prevent overfitting. With fewer parameters, through using GlobalAveragePooling, the dropouts layers can be reduced thus contributing to speed up the model training.
