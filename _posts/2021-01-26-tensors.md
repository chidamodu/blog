# Tensors

A tensor is a container for, almost always, numerical data and it is defined by the following attributes.


**The number of axes (rank or dimensions)**

A 3D tensor has 3 axes and a 1D tensor has 1 axis. The number of axes of a tensor also referred to as a rank, so a 3D tensor can be referred to as a tensor with rank 3. In the context of tensors, the number of axes also referred to as dimensions. But these are not the same as the dimensions in the context of vectors. It’s a little confusing, so let’s take a look at an example.

The vector x in the above example has 5 entries, so it is a 5-dimensional vector. But, at the same time, it’s a 1-dimensional tensor as shown below.

Well, a 5-dimensional tensor will have 5 axes with a number of dimensions (dimensions here mean entries) along each axis. 


**Shape**

It is typically represented as a tuple of integers representing the many entries that the tensor has in each axis. 
For example:

The tensor d in the above example is a 3D tensor with 3 axes.

The tensor d has the following shape:

In every of its 3 axes, the tensor has 3 rows and 5 columns.


**Data type**

This refers to the type of data contained in a tensor and it could be of type float32, uint8, and float64, etc.
