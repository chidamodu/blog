# Correlation coefficient

In order to define the correlation coefficient, we have to check out a few concepts.


**What is correlation?**
Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two or more variables move together.


**What is covariance?**
Covariance is another statistical measure that describes the degree to which two variables tend to deviate from their means in similar ways. But covariance is not unitless, which makes it difficult to use it to interpret anything about the relationship between the variables.


**Relationship between covariance and correlation coefficient**
The covariance is normalized by standard deviations of the variables to make it a dimensionless and unitless measure called the correlation coefficient.


**Correlation coefficient - a high level**
The correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the linear relationship that might be existing between two variables.

When the correlation coefficient of two variables is zero, it only indicates the absence of a 'linear' relationship between them and doesnâ€™t imply that the variables are independent.
