I created this blog with a goal to provide clarity on data science techniques and machine learning concepts. After 5 years into being a writer/marketing analyst/program manager, I got back to my forgotten love, i.e., coding. It wasn't an easy transition as you can imagine. So this site is also to remind me how far I have come and how far I should push myself to create new, awesome products. I have always loved writing. In fact, I ought to be a travel writer at some point. 

I love the idea of doing greater good to the community. Without the help of online and offline communities like blog writers, StackOverflow, Kaggle, startup communities in the Bay Area, and the numerous tech workshops/meetings that I have participated, I wouldn't have become a data nerd that I am today. So it's only fair to give back to the community.

My principle is simple: think first principles, break down a complex problem into fewer goals/tasks that can be solvable (easily if possible), and not to complicate using jargons. I strive to reflect my principle in my writings.

So come along! Hope you will enjoy reading my writeups :)
